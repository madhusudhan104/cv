  <h3>Project Description:</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Payment Integration Engine (PIE)</strong> is an integration system which interacts with all the
    internal and external applications (i.e. CHATS, ESS, SMU, IVR, KP.ORG, POS (Membership
    Administration direct access users), RMS, EPP and MNP) to process the payments. The rationale
    behind the PIE development is an integration layer between the KP Business Systems and the
    POS. KP has several independent systems that manage subscriber records. There is no single
    system that stores subscriber data and most of the regional systems are also separate. This
    program will also support direct access to users such as membership administration. So, PIE is
    introduced as an integration layer for all these systems.</p>
