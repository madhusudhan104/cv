  <h3>Project Description:</h3>
  <p>Microsoft is releasing the security patches/updates in frequent intervals and expecting all
    the machines are up to date with their updates. Problem comes when user never shutdown the
    system or shutdown the system for a long period. This is the one of the viable way particular
    vendors score will be getting down.</p>

    ODC machines and send a mail to the machine holder and supervisor as well, with detailed
    description of the non-compliance software’s list. As part of this project we are using windows
    Instrumentation Management (WMI) to connect to the machine in the ODC. Query the list of
    software’s installed in the machines using WMI Querying mechanism. Compare the installed
    software’s with valid list of software’s. Transform the non-compiled xml output list to the html
    with the help of Xslt. Prepare the mail content and sends across the machine holders</p>
