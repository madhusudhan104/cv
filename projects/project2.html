  <h3>Project Description:</h3>
  <p>A step towards promoting dynamic lecture-style classrooms</p>
  <p>
    The Instructor Authoring Tool of the Classroom Learning Partner project provides an
efficient tool for university professors and other teachers of lecture-style classrooms to construct
lecture slides that can easily accommodate effective in-class exercises. In designing such an
authoring tool, five criterions were taken into consideration: An enhanced ability to support
instructors' use of in-class exercises by facilitating the slide-generation process, the use of
Microsoft PowerPoint as a basic tool, enabling real-time feedback of student performance on
exercises, the leveraging of past student mistakes and misunderstood concepts in enhancing
teaching, and the support of an automatic tutoring system to be implemented at a later time.
These criterions were successfully met by the resulting instructor authoring tool, though
improvements towards facilitating the slide-generation process and support for real-time
feedback of student performance have yet to be tested in a formal academic setting.</p>
