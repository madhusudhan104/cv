  <h3>Project Description:</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Miscellaneous Payments Connect (MPC)</strong> is a web application that is developed to support and record payments
    that are not recorded in the underlying source systems at the time of payment but are posted there subsequently.
    MPS POS will solve for medical service, premium, and some Other Miscellaneous payments
    (not including petty cash type payments to employees) that are currently accepted into SIMS.
    Medical services payments (either F2F or processed remotely at a service center) will be posted
    immediately to KPHC from a KPHC workflow that
    integrates with the Tempus Payment Mate (PM) application via Epicâ€™s POSCOM component and
    uses a Pin Entry Device (PED) for credit card data to remain PCI compliant. Non-card tenders
    are also accepted, and all are accounted for in the end of day cash drawer procedures.</p>
